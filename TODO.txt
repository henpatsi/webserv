TODO

default 400 and 500 pages from config
default file to search when directory

check for std::next overflow / std::prev underflow
make delete not default to success page
make sure timeout response checks for epollout before write
	- also all other reads and writes
one read OR one write, so if EPOLLIN (or better, if request complete) else if EPOLLOUT
	- currently if request read fully in loop, writes in same loop
should read error try respond or immediately disconnect
currently not disconnecting if send fails?
send must also check for 0

- fix in main branch
request line length if empty line
check if anything after version
check for content type before checking its value
check that only max content length of content is being parsed, even if more available
