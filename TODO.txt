TODO

Default values for a route?

Check HttpRequest is HTTP/1.1 compliant



check for std::next overflow / std::prev underflow
make delete not default to success page


- fix in main branch
request line length if empty line
check if anything after version
check for content type before checking its value
check that only max content length of content is being parsed, even if more available
