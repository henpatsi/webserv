TODO

Default values for a route?

URI remove pre part
Check that URI pre part matches host header?

Check request host (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Host)
Check duplicate headers

Rework chunked read to allow partial reading or give error if chunk not fully given at once
    currently problematic if only part of a chunk is read on one passthrough

Check HttpRequest is HTTP/1.1 compliant

Timeout in Server.cpp for reading content (e.g. if time since connecting over 2s, disconnect)

See if timeout can be done better
Check the chunked request no newlines thing
