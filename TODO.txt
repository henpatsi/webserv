TODO

getting paths with spaces does not work from browser (encodes spaces as %20)

Timeout sometimes when hovering over link / typing url for over timeout time

one read OR one write, so if EPOLLIN (or better, if request complete) else if EPOLLOUT
	- currently if request read fully in loop, writes in same loop
should read error try respond or immediately disconnect
currently not disconnecting if send fails?
send must also check for 0
