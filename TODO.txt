TODO

Merge getAnswer and HttpResponse
Merge connect and HttpRequest
Actually use ServerManager etc.
Make HttpRequest first read header (very short timeout), then try read request each loop
Check HttpRequest is HTTP/1.1 compliant



See if timeout can be done better
Fix timeout starting when hovering over link?
Check the chunked request no newlines thing
