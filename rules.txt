RULES

"Although the line terminator for the start-line and fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR."
	As far as I can tell, we don't accept 

A recipient of a bare CR MUST consider that element to be invalid or replace each bare CR with SP before processing the element or forwarding the message. 
	Currently not handled. Not sure where to test. Check that when \r is found, next char is \n in readLine? 

A recipient that receives whitespace between the start-line and the first header field MUST either reject the message as invalid or consume each whitespace-preceded line without further processing of it (i.e., ignore the entire line, along with any subsequent lines preceded by whitespace, until a properly formed header field is received or the header section is terminated).
	in parseHeader:	
		if (!std::isspace(line[0]))
Should whitespace be allowed at the beginning of a header line if the first header line is correct? Or is it ok to reject any header lines starting with ws?

ERRORS ABOVE: 400 (Bad Request)

are we handling this? if yes, how?
	GET /where?q=now HTTP/1.1
	Host: www.example.org

 If the target URI's path component is empty, the client MUST send "/" as the path within the origin-form of request-target. 

Whitespace before and after value in header line IS OPTIONAL.
